Homework 3
===========

Great news! We started shopping around your last two homeworks (hope you don'd mind) and although no one was interested in buying your cat tracking software, we did get a request from a local burger joint. Jessica's Burgers is looking to update their aging ordering system to the 21st century, and they want YOU to help. So in an effort to ~~make us loads of cash~~ improve your coding skills, this homework will focus on making a web app which will help Petey's customers get their delicous burgers even quicker (more delicously). 

Here's what it will look like:

You will have a database which will store burger orders. Each order will contain only one burger (two burgers is just too many). Each orders DB entry will specify the ingredients the customer ordered on the burger. You will set up this database using whats called a "has many" relationship. So in your database an order will "have many" ingredients.

/ingredient/new -> form which will allow the owner of Jessica's (Mario) to input new ingredients.
